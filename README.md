# Slav Weather App.

 This is my first small webapp in which I've used GIT version controller. The main reason of creating this app is practise fetching some data form external public API in this case I've used [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).

 ## How to use

 The API which I've used is not perfect and it has some CORS issues. So if you want to be 100% sure that app will run smoothly on your browser please make a sure that you have some CORS changer plugin added to your browser. I've used [Moesif Origin & CORS CHANGER](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) for my Chrome.
 Right now you can enjoy while using my app! On the nav you can choose date options. Avalible optios are: today, tomorrow and next 5 days(default is set as today). After that you have to click on the flag of the country to check weather in it's Capital City.

The app was designed by Mateusz Gru≈∫la.

## Final thoughts
As I've previously mentioned this app was made just for learing and practice of fetch in JavaScript.

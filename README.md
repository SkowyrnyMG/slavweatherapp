# Slav Weather App.

 This is my first small webapp in which I've used GIT version controller. The main reason of creating this app is practise fetching some data form external public API in this case I've used [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).

 ## How to use

 The API which I've used is not perfect and it has some CORS issues. So if you want to be 100% sure that app will run smoothly on your browser please make a sure that you have some CORS changer plugin added to your browser. I've used [Moesif Origin & CORS CHANGER](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) for my Chrome.

## Author

The app was designed by Mateusz Gru≈∫la.

## Final thoughts

In next commits I want to add even more features as 'next day' or '5 days weather' + some better graphic interface.
